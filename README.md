# Smartwatch Market Segmentation Analysis ⌚📊

Welcome to the Smartwatch Market Segmentation Analysis repository! This project aims to explore and segment the smartwatch market using customer data, focusing on Intel's strategic positioning and partnership opportunities.

## **Overview** 🌟

This repository contains an R script that performs a detailed analysis of customer preferences to identify distinct market segments. The analysis helps in understanding customer needs and tailoring marketing strategies effectively. Below is a high-level summary of the steps involved in the analysis:

1. **Data Handling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📈:
   - **Data Import**: The script imports customer data from an Excel file.
   - **EDA**: Calculates and visualizes the importance of various features to understand which aspects customers value the most.

2. **Data Standardization** ⚖️:
   - **Standardization**: Normalizes the data to ensure that all variables contribute equally to the clustering process, removing any effects due to different scales.

3. **Optimal Number of Clusters** 🔍:
   - **Elbow Method**: Determines the optimal number of clusters by analyzing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and identifying the point where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns.
   - **Silhouette Method**: Validates the optimal number of clusters by assessing the quality of clustering through silhouette scores.

4. **Clustering Analysis** 🧩:
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Uses Ward’s method to perform hierarchical clustering and generate a dendrogram for visual cluster analysis.
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Applies the k-means algorithm to segment the data into the final number of clusters determined through previous steps.

5. **Cluster Description** 📝:
   - **Segment Profiling**: Analyzes and describes the characteristics of each identified cluster, including customer preferences, demographic information, and other relevant attributes.

## **Getting Started** 🚀

To replicate this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:
